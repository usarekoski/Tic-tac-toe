# Tic-tac-toe

A simple 2-player text-based Tic-tac-toe game ([see more] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)).

Played on 3x3 grid, players add mark with symbol X or O
to the grid in turns until one player gets three symbols in
to a row. They can be vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
The player who starts second gets one turn after first player
gets three in a row and can try to get the game to a draw.

Run the game with `$ ./game.rb` or `$ ruby game.rb`.
